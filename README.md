I.	Submission 1 Results 
a.	Score: 0.66918
b.	Brief Description of Method Used: 
Used k-nearest neighbor in the caret library to create a prediction model. 

II.	Submission 2 Results 
a.	Score: 0.7183
b.	Brief description of method used and what you did differently from 1st submission: 
Used a tree bag from the caret library to create a prediction model. 


III.	Submission 3 Results 
a.	Score: 0.70699
b.	Brief description of method used and what you did differently from 2nd submission:
Created a stack model with the following models: neural network, xgbtree, k-nearest neighbor, svmLinear, gbm, mlp, random forest, and logistic regression. Note #2 was not used. 


IV.	Github Repository with my code:
a.	URL: https://github.com/rachelpourre/Ghosts


V.	On your README file in your GitHub repository for this project, answer the following (1pt):
a.	What is the overall purpose of this project?
b.	What do each file in your repository do?
c.	What methods did you use to clean the data or do feature engineering?
d.	What methods did you use to generate predictions?

The overall purpose of this project is to predict whether the type of a ghost. The file for Sub1 has code for submission #1 and #2 described above. File Sub2 has the code for submission #3 above. The variables provided were used for the models as factors. For predictions, many models were used, included a knn, tree bag and stack model with several models.
